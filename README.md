Fall Furl Universal game for Windows and Windows Phone
==================
This is the Fall Fury game, originally published at http://fallfury.codeplex.com/ It uses DirectX and the DirectX Toolkit. I ported this game over for BUILD 2014 as a proof of concept for Universal Windows and Windows Phone apps. There are still a few bugs - specifically around the resolution on Windows Phone side. Currently, the app runs fine on the 1080p 6 inch simulator. The resolution on the app is fixed via a viewbox in the XAML container.

The code is released under the accompanying Ms-PL license
